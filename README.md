# hello-world

Hi everyone!

My name is Colin and im just starting out learning how to code. I am currently going to school for my computer science degree and working two jobs while trying to learn some code on my own. If anyone see's this and has any advice for me please contact me on tips to learn anything that has to do with java, html, CSS, JavaScript, or even any languages or frameworks you believe I should learn. Thank you if you actually read this! You can contact me either on GitHub or by my email colintombs123@hotmail.com but if you do email me try to include a well documented subject feild because my inbox is filled with junk. Thank you and I'm glad to be joining the community
